                    Beer can be divided into many styles, each style has a different history and characteristics. There are many different beer styles to choose from on the American craft beer market. So, what is the difference between different styles of beer? Which states are rich in craft beerï¼ŸLet us take a look at these different styles of beer from different angles.</p>

It was collected from CraftCans.com in January 2017. The data contains many variables. This visualization only uses variables related to the project theme, including: style, ABV, IBU, and state.</p>

                    The tree map shows the different beer styles in the market. The area of each rectangle represents the number of products of the style. The percentage of each style (the number of products of that style divided by the total number of products) were added to help readers perceive the quantitative differences between styles. The tree map was selected because it shows both the variety and the proportion. This align with my purpose, which is to show the diversity of beer styles and then identify some of the most common styles for later analysis.

                    All the entries of beer products was grouped by the styles. In order to make the Tree map more readable, some beer styles with infrequent entires were filtered out from this visualizations. The threshold is set to be 30 products. If a styles has less than 30 products on the market, then it is considered less relevant. Five beer styles with the most beer products were screened out during this process and used as a focused group in the following visualizations.

This visualization shows the number of products in different bitterness ranges.

The color coding here is used to distinguish different beer styles.The audience can also select the "beer style" to be displayed by clicking the filter.

It can be seen that bitterness is positively correlated with alcohol content, and beer with higher alcohol content is usually more bitter.

                    Above is a grouped bar chart with a circular layout. The data is divided into five groups based on five beer styles, showing the number of beer products produced in different states. From the figure, we can see that Colorado and California produce more beer. Especially Colorado, it is the largest producer of the four styles.

                    Colors are used to encode different styles. In group, the bars are arranged in descending order. In this way, we can see which states produce more. A advantage of circular layout is efficient use of space. One disadvantage of the circular layout is that the bar data is more difficult to read. It is necessary to use more prominent auxiliary lines, thus, the circular grids are drawn over the bars.
